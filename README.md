# Flight-Delay-Prediction
This project predicts flight delays using machine learning models like KNN and Decision Tree. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to help identify patterns and improve flight schedule reliability.
📂 Files Included
Predict_Delay_in_Flight_.ipynb – The main Jupyter notebook containing:

Data preprocessing

Feature selection & engineering

Model training (e.g., KNN, Decision Tree, etc.)

Evaluation metrics and visualizations

📊 Dataset
Note: Dataset source details can be added if you're using a public dataset.

Features may include: departure time, arrival time, airline, distance, weather, and status (delayed/on-time).

Target variable: Flight Delay Status

🧠 Models Used
